IoT (Internet of Things) is a rapidly growing technology that can bring significant changes to modern life. Since its invention, the single board computers such as Raspberry Pi has been an integral part of IoT solutions.   

Although there are several operating systems in the market that can run on IoT devices, Windows IoT (formerly Windows Embedded) family of operating systems is rapidly gaining popularity. Windows IoT Core is an optimized operating system for low cost industry devices like Raspberry Pi and its free.   

In this article I’ll show you how to send data from Raspberry PI running Windows IoT Core to Azure IoT hub.

> This blog assumes that you have basic understanding of C#, .NET, .NET Core and Visual Studio.   

# **Source Code**

The source code used in this tutorial can be found at my [GitHub](https://github.com/prashanth-nagaraj/ElectricityUsageMonitor) repository.

# **Prerequisites**

- Raspberry Pi Model 2/3B (You can buy from official site [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/))
- SD card suitable for your Pi model.
- Visual Studio 2017 with Universal Windows Platform tools (You can download free community edition [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/))
- Enable Windows Developer Mode in your Desktop. Follow [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development))
- Azure subscription (You can get free subscription [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/))

# **Set up Raspberry Pi**

Follow the steps given [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot-core/tutorials/quickstarter/devicesetup) and
- Install Windows IoT Core on to your SD card. 
- Once the OS is flashed on to SD card insert this SD card in to your Raspberry PI.
- Connect your Raspberry Pi to the network. Make sure your laptop and raspberry pi are connected to same network.

# **Create Azure IoT Hub**

IoT Hub is a managed service that acts as a central message hub for bi-directional communication between your IoT application and the devices it manages.  

Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) | Create a resource | Internet of Things | IoT Hub.

![loading image...]({{site.baseurl}}/img/1/create-iot-hub.gif)

**Subscription** 	- Choose your subscription    
**Resource Group** 	– Create a new resource group and name it “electricity-usage-resource-group”    
**Region** 			– Choose nearest region to you    
**IoT Hub Name** 	– Enter “electricity-usage-iot-hub” or choose the name you like     

![loading image...]({{site.baseurl}}/img/1/create-iot-hub-subscription.jpg)

Click Next | Select “F1: Free Tier” under Pricing and scale tier and leave rest as it is | Review and Create.

Next, add an IoT device to your IoT Hub application. IoT device is a device identity registry in IoT Hub. Ideally every physical IoT device will have a new IoT device registry added in IoT Hub. IoT device on IoT Hub can be perceived as a logical entity for a physical IoT device. The data exchange between IoT Hub and Physical IoT device happens through this device registry endpoints.   

Select All resources | electricity-usage-iot-hub resource | IoT devices | Click Add

![loading image...]({{site.baseurl}}/img/1/add-iot-hub-device.jpg)

**Device Id** – “electricity-usage-simulated-sensor” or choose the name you like   

And leave rest of the options as it is. Click Save.    

After device is created, you can see the list of devices you created in ‘IoT Devices’ section. Click on the device which you just created and copy the Connection string (primary key) and store it. You need this later to connect from code to Azure IoT Hub.

# **Create UWP application**

Create a headless UWP application that can be deployed to Raspberry Pi. Headless applications are the background applications that doesn’t have any UI. The applications which has UI are called Headed application. An IoT device running Windows IoT Core can have any number of headless applications, but it can have only one headed application enabled.

Install Windows IoT project templates from visual studio market place. Launch Visual Studio | Go to Tools | Extensions and Updates | Search for “Windows IoT core project templates” and click Install.

![loading image...]({{site.baseurl}}/img/1/add-windows-iot-templates.jpg)

Go to File | New | Project | Select Background Application (IoT) under Windows IoT Core template.    

Enter “ElectricityUsageMonitor” for name and click OK.    

![loading image...]({{site.baseurl}}/img/1/create-uwp-application.jpg)

You will get a pop up to select Windows Target Version and Minimum version. Select the defaults and click OK.

You need Microsoft.Devices.Azure.Client NuGet package to interact with Azure IoT Hub. So, Install this package from the NuGet gallery.

# **Let’s look at Some Code**

In this example we will use a simulated electricity usage provider to collect electricity usage data, which we are going to send to Azure IoT Hub. But in real world there will be actual sensors that collect data.    

Replace StartupTask.cs file with the below code.

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Windows.ApplicationModel.Background;

namespace ElectricityUsageMonitor
{
    public sealed partial class StartupTask : IBackgroundTask
    {
        private BackgroundTaskDeferral _deferral;
        private IElectricityUsageProvider _electricityUsageProvider;
        private DeviceClient _deviceClient;
        private const string connectionString = “<replace>”;
        private const int maxReadings = 5;

        public void Run(IBackgroundTaskInstance taskInstance)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("Task Started");
            Initialize(taskInstance);
            SendElectricityUsageToCloud();
        }

        private void Initialize(IBackgroundTaskInstance taskInstance)
        {
            _electricityUsageProvider = new SimulatedElectricityUsageProvider();
            _deferral = taskInstance.GetDeferral();
            _deviceClient = DeviceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
        }
        private async void SendElectricityUsageToCloud()
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("Sending electricity usage to cloud");
            double currentUsage;
            for (int i = 0; i < maxReadings; i++)
            {
                currentUsage = _electricityUsageProvider.GetCurrentUsage();

                var electricityUsageData = new
                {
                    DeviceName = "SimulatedElectricityProvider",
                    Time = DateTime.Now.ToString(),
                    CurrentUsage = currentUsage
                };

                var electricityUsageJson = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(electricityUsageData);
                using (var electricityUsage = new Message(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(electricityUsageJson)))
                {
                    electricityUsage.ContentEncoding = "utf-8";
                    electricityUsage.ContentType = "application/json";

                    Debug.WriteLine("{0} - Sending usage - {1}", DateTime.Now, electricityUsageJson);
                    await _deviceClient.SendEventAsync(electricityUsage);
                }
                await Task.Delay(1000);
            }

            _deferral.Complete();
        }
    }
}

```
